According to study results, higher-order interactions are becoming more generally accepted as an essential element of complex systems. Hypergraphs may be used to explore the relationships between higher-order structures and functions in complex systems and capture higher-order interactions. After the initial failure of a hypergraph network, cascading failures may occur, just as they can with a simple network. Previous research has concentrated on random initial failures, and how hypergraph networks adapt to targeted attacks remains unanswered. In this research, we build a mathematical framework to explore the robustness of hypergraph networks against targeted attacks based on the magnitude of the hyperedgeâ€™s cardinality. We discovered that when the probability of large cardinality hyperedges being deleted grows, the network becomes more fragile.
