I’m a Master’s student at [Kyushu Institute of Technology](https://www.kyutech.ac.jp/), working on human behavior recognition in medical scenarios using pose estimation and AI technologies.

My research focuses on Human Activity Recognition, Image Recognition, and Computer Vision. And i am also interested in applying machine learning models to analyze visual information and improve intelligent recognition systems.
